# LibraryManagementSystem
Library management system with object oriented technic
In this project we builded “Library Management System” using object-oriented 
programming techniques. This program used books.txt file that we created as a database 
where each line represented a single book. At each line, book name, author, release date 
and number of pages will be kept and separated with a comma.
